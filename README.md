## üéôÔ∏è MOODECHO ‚Äî Emotion Detection from Speech

**Voice Mood Detector** is a real-time emotion recognition system that analyzes a user‚Äôs voice to predict their emotional state. Built using deep learning and audio processing techniques, the app offers a simple web interface where users can either **record their voice live** or **upload a `.wav` file** to detect emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, neutral**, and more.

### üîç Key Features:

* **Real-time voice recording** using `st_audiorec` in the browser.
* **Automatic emotion detection** using a trained CNN model on MFCC audio features.
* **Intuitive Streamlit UI** for seamless interaction.
* **Confidence scores** for all emotion classes.
* Lightweight model (only \~2MB), ensuring fast and responsive performance.

---

### üß† How It Works:

1. **Voice Input**: Users either record or upload a `.wav` audio sample.
2. **Feature Extraction**: The system uses `librosa` to extract MFCC features from the audio.
3. **Model Prediction**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) processes the features and outputs the predicted emotion.
4. **Result Display**: The most likely emotion and associated confidence scores are displayed to the user.
